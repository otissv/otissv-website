No one enjoys reading legal documents or terms and conditions but unfortunately, things like these are needed in the world and with legislation such as the GDPR (which you can read more about here) becoming all more common in the world, web developers like myself need to do ensure they do their part to help maintain user's privacy and security.

Overview
I don't plan on making this a long-winded document that will cause most people to switch off before they get to the truly important information. For this reason, I'm going to make this as concise as possible will also still addressing all of the required points.

So, without further or do let's get into it...

Introduction
Hi, welcome to my website. I'm Coner and this website (conermurphy.com) is my portfolio and blog for all of the content I create and share with the world. This ranges from things like blog posts and notes to my portfolio of work including both personal projects and projects from previous clients.

Information Collected
My website serves purely as an information source for users to use to learn, develop and be inspired for their next project. There is also some optional functionality included in the form of email newsletter signup forms which allow me to collect a users email address onto my email newsletter for future communication but this is completely optional.

Website analytics have also been included on this website in the form of Google Analytics but this is completely optional and as per regulation is on an opt-in only basis. If you choose to ignore or decline the cookie popup shown on entry to the website then only cookies stating the refusal are added. More information is given on this below.

Collection Method
There are 2 forms of data collection used on this website, these are detailed below:

Manual: A user can optionally decide to sign up for my newsletter this is hosted on ConvertKit, therefore if a user decides to signup for my newsletter using the included forms on this website their information ( email address ) would be shared and stored on ConvertKit's infrastructure.
